Now we will convert the above code to be runbymultiple processes for speed up.
 1. Writeahandlerfunction that will do the following (reuse the code from previous example)
 a. Collect the main page of SummerOlympics Wikipedia for this task, the page is here:
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games . Note that you might need to use headers for fetching this page.

 b. NowcreateadatabaseCreate aSQLite database named ‘OlympicsData.db’ and a
 table named ‘SummerOlympics’ with the following columns:
   Name(e.g. “2012 SummerOlympics”, in title of wikipedia pages)
   WikipediaURL
   Year (the year when its conducted)
   HostCity (the city where its hosted)
   ParticipatingNations (List of the participating nations)
   Athletes (number of athletes)
   Sports (list of sports)
   Rank_1_nation
   Rank_2_nation
   Rank_3_nation
   DONE_OR_NOT_DONE(a1or0variablesignifying whether fetched or not respectively)

  c.
 Parse the html from step 1 and extract the individual summer olympics wiki page
 urls for TEN olympics from the last 50 years, i.e., from 1968 to 2020.

 d. insert the WikipediaURL for each row and set DONE_OR_NOT_DONEas0forall.
 

2. Nowthehandlercodewillspawnthreeprocesses using os.system call. Example of this call
 import os
 os.system(“python3 scraper.py&”)
 This will run “python3 scraper.py” in a separate process.
 

3. Thisiswhatscraper.py will do
 a. Itwill check the database for rows where DONE_OR_NOT_DONEflag is 0.
 b. Itwill pick a row whereDONE_OR_NOT_DONEis0(ifnosuchrow,scraper.py will exit).
 c. For the rowchosen, scraper.py will first set the DONE_OR_NOT_DONE to 1.
 d. Thenitwill fetch the wikipedia page using URL in the WikipediaURL column
 e. NextusingbeautifulSoup it will parse the page and populate the columns mentioned in step 1.b. corresponding row in the database
 

4. Writeachecker.py code that can check the database and
 a. Reportif all the database rows are populated, i.e., there is no DONE_OR_NOT_DONE which is set to 0 and noprocess is working (figure out how do you check that?)
 b. Ifall database rows are populated, then print answers to the following:
   i. What are the years you choose?
   ii. Which country was within top 3 for the maximum time in your database?
   iii.What is the average number of athletes?
